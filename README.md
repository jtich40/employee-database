## Usage
Before starting the app, make sure to install all dependencies and connect with the sql database. Once connected to the database, add the schema and seed to populate all tables. To initialize the app, simply open the terminal and run the command "npm start" or "node index.js" in the root directory. You will be presented with a series of prompts that will allow you to view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a new department, add a new role, add a new employee, and update a current employee. When you are finished, simply choose the "Quit" option on the main menu to exit the app. You can visit this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13o18Qd8q0RRiaKcx2GiTPOdEg8h7tnE0/view) to watch a live demo of the app.
